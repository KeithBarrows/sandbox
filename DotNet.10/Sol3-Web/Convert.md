# Converting an Angular Project to a .NET 10 Project

Converting an Angular project into a .NET 10 project involves integrating the Angular frontend with a .NET backend. This process typically involves creating a new .NET project, setting up the Angular app to serve as the frontend, and configuring the .NET backend to serve the Angular app. Below are the steps to achieve this:

---

### 1. **Create a New .NET 10 Project**
Run the following command in the terminal to create a new .NET 10 web application:

```bash
dotnet new web -o C:\Repos\sandbox-1\DotNet.10\Sol3-Web
```

This creates a new .NET 10 web project in the specified directory.

---

### 2. **Copy the Angular Project**
Copy the contents of your Angular project ([`/C:/Repos/sandbox-1/Angular/sol3-web/`](/C:/Repos/sandbox-1/Angular/sol3-web/ )) into a folder named `ClientApp` inside the newly created .NET project:

```plaintext
C:\Repos\sandbox-1\DotNet.10\Sol3-Web\ClientApp
```

---

### 3. **Install the SPA Middleware**
Install the required middleware for serving the Angular app from the .NET backend:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaServices.Extensions
```

---

### 4. **Configure the .NET Project to Serve Angular**
Modify the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file (depending on the project template) to serve the Angular app. Add the following configuration:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

// Serve static files from Angular's "dist" folder
app.UseDefaultFiles();
app.UseStaticFiles();

app.MapFallbackToFile("index.html");

app.Run();
```

---

### 5. **Build the Angular App**
Navigate to the `ClientApp` folder and build the Angular app for production:

```bash
cd C:\Repos\sandbox-1\DotNet.10\Sol3-Web\ClientApp
ng build --prod
```

This generates the production build of the Angular app in the `dist` folder.

---

### 6. **Serve the Angular App from .NET**
Ensure the `dist` folder is copied to the `wwwroot` folder of the .NET project. Update the Angular build output path in `angular.json` to point directly to `wwwroot`:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "sol3-web": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "options": {
            "outputPath": "../wwwroot"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rebuild the Angular app after making this change.

---

### 7. **Run the .NET Project**
Run the .NET project to verify the integration:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port) to see the Angular app served by the .NET backend.

---

### Notes:
- Ensure that the Angular app's API calls are correctly routed to the .NET backend.
- You may need to configure CORS or proxy settings if the Angular app and .NET backend communicate during development.
