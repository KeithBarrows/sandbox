# The Tale of Dependency Injection: A Limerick Collection

### The Service Collection

There once was a collector of things,
That gathered up services' strings,
IServiceCollection,
Made registration,
Before the app's lifetime begins!

### The Service Provider

A provider then takes up the role,
Of serving each service's soul,
It reads from the list,
That Collection insists,
And helps keep the system quite whole!

### The Lifetime Saga

Three lifetimes, we have to declare,
Each service must pick one to wear:
Singleton stays,
Scoped through request plays,
While Transient's fresh everywhere!

### The Registration Tale

To register services with care,
AddScoped and AddSingleton there,
In Program we write,
The bindings just right,
So classes can find pairs with flair!

### The Constructor Story

Constructor injection's the way,
To get what we need for the day,
The Provider knows how,
To serve items now,
No "new" keyword getting in way!

### The Builder's Song

Our builder configures with ease,
The services meant to appease,
With extension galore,
And options in store,
Like perfectly organized bees!

### The Resolution Finale

When all has been registered well,
The Provider has stories to tell,
It gives what we need,
With excellent speed,
Like magic under its spell!

### A Technical Note (in Limerick form)

So when you need services dear,
Remember these patterns so clear:
Collection to list,
Provider assists,
And dependency problems disappear!

```csharp
// A quick example to show
services.AddScoped<IHello>();      // Collection does know
var provider = builder.Build();    // Provider will grow
var myService = provider.GetService<IHello>(); // And now it will flow!
```

_And that's how dependency injection works in .NET, told through the magic of limericks!_
