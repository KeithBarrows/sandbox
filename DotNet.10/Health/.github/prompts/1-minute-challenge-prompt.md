# **Storyline**

"Just eat everything in moderation!" sounds reasonable, but here's the thing—your glucose doesn't care about portion size if the food spikes you to 180.

## Recent client data:

- 1 slice of pizza: glucose to 165
- 2 slices of pizza: glucose to 170
- The spike already started with slice #1. The "moderation" didn't matter.

## What worked instead: 
- Understanding YOUR glucose response to foods, not following generic rules.

## My approach: 
- Test foods based on the recommended serving size to establish a baseline. If it spikes you over 140, that food needs a strategy (protein buffer, walking, timing) or it needs to be occasional, not moderate.

# 1-Minute Challenge

## Try this:
- Pick one "healthy" food you eat regularly. Pay attention to how you feel 1-2 hours after eating it. Energized or sluggish? Satisfied or craving more?

## Track it for yourself

- Currently, save all data in several local JSON files
    - Meal/drink file
    - Tracking file (see below)
- Step 1
    - Select a meal/drink to track
- Step 2
    - Save the time when you start the consumption
    - Save the glucose reading as well
- Step 3
    - Consume your meal/drink
- Step 4
    - Save the time when you end the consumption
    - Save the glucose reading as well
- Step 5
    - Every 5 minutes, with an alert, for the next 90 minutes save the glucose reading

## Notice

- At the end of the 90 minute window, save how you feel:
    - Energized and satisfied, or tired and wanting more food?

## What this tells you

- If you feel tired or hungry again quickly, that food is spiking your glucose.

## For Anaytical Members

- Try the same food 3 different days and see if the pattern holds
- This is your personal data.
