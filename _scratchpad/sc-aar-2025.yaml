      The third Trip Tik Guided Tour went very well thanks to our Guide, @Jen Hoshi
      who introduced us to magnificent views of Minmatar Space and led us to discover
      interactive Trip Tik sites!
      Our scout helped to clear one of them from the little rat that lives there so we
      could jump the acceleration gate safely, thanks a lot @Strelnikova!
      Another special mention for the effort of all the attendees who brought a large
      motley crew of rust-and-duct-tape ships. The fleet was a sight in itself!

      We came, we conquered, got dropped on and called it a night.
      Overall a fun little fleet cut short just as it was starting to have fun.
      Will have to make some plans for next time we have party crashers to keep the fun going.
      I have an idea, more to follow later.
      Thanks for the great turnout and hope you all had as much fun as I did.

      The fourth Trip Tik Guided Tour went very well thanks to our Guide, @Strelnikova
      who lead us through a brilliant storytelling in Gallente space during which we
      learned a lot about their culture and history but also about New Eden as a whole
      with the visit of the Seyllin system.

      Our scout helped to keep us safe in the LS systems, thanks a lot @Dizzy Dorasdottir!

      @Strelnikova even jumped to take lead of the fleet as RL called me out to take care
      of my little one. Well done, comrade :o7pup:.

      Thanks as well to all attendees who gathered a nice variety of Gallente ships.

    organizer: "Arachnis"
    description: >
      This was the first fleet with the new "Heavy Shield" battlecruiser doctrine, in a C6 magnetar to boot.
      It was certainly engaging; let's put it that way. 😛

      We ran 2 anomalies very quickly, including drifters. The main strength of this shield setup over armor is
      certainly its raw firepower. Sleepers and drifters alike crumbled like wet paper. Unfortunately, 2 Basis
      weren't quite enough to handle the incoming damage from a C6 relic site, and we lost both our logi in the
      last wave. @Dude Johnson and @Strelnikova both put up a heroic effort, even somehow managing to save my
      Cenotaph mid-hull. Sadly, no amount of effort can beat simple math. To run C6 relics safely with this
      doctrine and likely the armor version as well, 3 logi are needed (datas and anoms are easier).

      Unable to run sites with no logi, we evacuated the system to regroup and reship. Bob wasn't done entertaining
      Himself yet: our exit wormhole into the C2 leading back to HS collapsed right as the fleet was jumping through
      it, leaving some members stranded, though they simply scanned down the new C2 static and got a HS connection
      in a system right next to our old one. After people reshipped, we went back in and right back out after I made
      a bad target call in a Core Bastion and accidentally spawned the next wave early. Oops!

      All that said, we still made out with 1,559,999,354 ISK in loot, coming out to 74,285,683 per pilot. Thank you
      @Graphite for the consistently great looting work, and thank you everyone for coming!

      I'm pleased to report that this fleet was painless and even a bit boring. We ran 7 sites in total in a C6
      magnetar with no losses, though there was a close call in a The Mirror [sic]. Finding a decent connection took
      quite some time, though I suppose that's the tradeoff of not being bothered by anyone.

      A total of 19 pilots participated, with 2 first-timers and 3 more second-timers. Loot totaled to 3,403,175,509
      ISK, for 179,114,500 ISK per member. Thank you logi for keeping us alive, and thank you @Graphite for scanning
      us a way out after our HS connection collapsed. Only possible fit adjustment at the moment is adding MWDs to
      more ships unless people have other ideas. Thank you for coming, and if you didn't get paid, please let me know
      ASAP.

      trivias and challenges at Choonka's Diner. Questions were asked, dice were rolled and dirty ships were cleaned
      up.

      @Tamayo was generous with gifts of all sorts and we all had a lot of fun 🙂

      Thanks a lot @Nihaan Kumar who scouted the way through the LS jumps.

      And of course, thanks to all attendees who gathered a nice variety of dirty ships.

      Hello. It's me, mediocre pilot and conman Arachnis. You're probably wondering why I'm standing here in the Zoohen
      hangar in front of this Pacifier spinning on a turntable like at a trade show and speaking in this deep calming
      voice that invokes a sense of trust.

      It's because I want to talk to you about FedoWow! You'll be saying Wow! when you get a look at FedoWow! It's a
      fedo! It's a sponge! It's a zkill link! A regular wet towel will brick your Astero, but not FedoWow! Order now
      and I'll throw in a second FedoWow! absolutely free plus shipping and handling. But wait, there's more! Call in
      the next 20 minutes and you too can enjoy a nice 3,340,602,247 ISK loot total, coming out to 238,614,446 ISK per
      pilot. 13 pilots participated in total, including 3 first-timers. We ran 7 sites, sticking to Core Citadels along
      with Drifter bashing due to only having 2 logi. Thank you logi for keeping us alive, and thank you to everyone
      who participated! If you didn't get paid (FedoWOW! sold separately), please let me know ASAP.

      This fleet went off flawlessly, with 14 pilots including 1 first-timer running 9 sites (plus drifters) for a loot
      total of 4,348,752,636 ISK, coming out to 289,916,842 per pilot. No ships were lost, though a few hits made it
      into armor and were quickly cleaned up by @Dude Johnson and @Lixiana Vor'shan on logi.

      I'll try a minor order-of-operations change for the next fleet: instead of bashing each site's drifter after
      running that site, we'll run sites in pairs: clear the second site, then warp directly to the first site's
      drifter spawn and kill it, then do the same for the second site. This'll remove the awkwardness of needing to
      pilot around the huge pancake structure to get back to the drifter spawn location for every site.

      Thank you to everyone who participated in this fleet, especially the 2 logi pilots, and thank you @Graphite for
      scanning a HS exit and salvaging for us! If you didn't get paid, please let me know ASAP.

      This fleet was ever so slightly larger than the last one, with 18 pilots including 2 first-timers. We ran 9 sites,
      including 7 anomalies and 2 data sites, for a loot total of 5,317,130,170 ISK, coming out to 295,396,120 per pilot.
      We lost one Confessor to alpha damage in a data site, despite the noble efforts of our logi.

      Unfortunately, the revised Drifter timing strategy isn't viable due to the sites themselves despawning so much
      faster than expected.

      Thank you to everyone who participated, especially our 3 logi of @Dude Johnson @Isaac Apylon and @Strelnikova.

    description: >
      Today @Strelnikova @Aurelia @Troden Treadwell and @Woolpolecat formed up a fleet in Zoohen to clear SoF AIR
      program at 12:30 EVE.

      Our goal was to clear all the not self-clearable SoF perks:
      https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/AIR_Career_Program#Soldier_of_Fortune
      This has been done following:
      https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Signal_Cartel_Friendly_Fire_Guide

      A total of 750 Career Points (CP) is required
      Everyone can reach by him/herself a total of 360 CP by completing, under SoF tree:
      Career Agent Missions (100 CP);
      Social (85 CP);
      Combat (90 CP);
      Destruction (85 CP);

      So we needed at least 390 more CP to get to a total minimum of 750 CP.
      We cleared these perks:
      Capacitor Warfare: Neut and drain the given amounts of capacitor from another players ship (120 CP);
      Electronic Warfare: Use different types of Electronic Warfare for 300 seconds each on other player's ships. (100 CP);
      Duels: Participate in the given number of duels. You can have duels with several players at once but only one open
      duel invitation. (75 CP).
      Support: Remote repair given amounts of shields/armor of another player's ship. (100 CP).

      We used our Zoohen Office's provisions.

      Every T1 frig was fitted only with HS, MS and Drones.
      Heron is particularly effective for its 5 Mid Slots (space for every mid mod you need: web, painter, w scram, w
      disrupt and weapon disrupt).
      Drones are useful because you will need to chew on other's shields and armor (you can't rep them if those are
      full) and you don't have turrets or launcher fitted to make space to neuts, nosfy and/or armor and shield reppers
      (that should be fitted along with batteries to help with little cap).
      A minimum of one refit was is required to clear all perks.

      Everything went well except an accidental kill on @Troden Treadwell operated by @Woolpolecat's too excited drones
      https://zkillboard.com/kill/127514601/
      @Aldar Roanaok I'm available for any clarification on the occurred accident.

    description: >
      This was the sequel to Bring Out Your Drake, but now in an even nicer neighbourhood, a C5 shattered magnetar.

      It gave us a nice, chill bit of ratting, generating around 4B ISK, I think, did the math using my fingers and toes. 🙄

      The only real bits of excitement came from our own quirks, inexperience and, dare I say, hubris.

      We had one pilot lost along the way, mainly due to the brain fog I was operating under. I just couldn't keep track
      of everyone, and once it became clear we had lost someone, I didn’t have the mental acuity to figure out how, when,
      or come up with a way to fix it.

      On the next fleet, I plan to tether @Infotropy to my ship to make sure we don’t lose him again! 😄

      We ran a number of sites (it’s all a blur now), some say six, some say more.
      The only one I clearly remember is the one where some buffoon forgot to scram the Drifter, resulting in a bit of a
      chase around the system.

      Somewhere towards the end of proceedings I was fast running out of steam and to I'm sure some relief, voice. Thanks
      @Arachnis for stepping in and trying to shot call totally random tagging.

      The only bit of excitement on the way back to Zoo was provided by @Graphite, who I presume, for the same reason moths
      are drawn to a flame, decided to return to a gate camp to keep an eye on it, and got fried, just like the moth. 🔥🦋

      Either way, not too boring a trip, and one I feel may be worth repeating.

      We had formed the fleet up at 1800 EVE time and got underway, blitzing missions with 7 members. All was an
      overwhelming show of force on the poor pirates of EVE, our only loss was No Math who became primary during an
      attempt to rescue a Damsel in Distress! His Maller was unable to withstand the newly arrived pleasure garden
      forces who took out their aggression on him. He promptly reshipped into a Coercer for salvage operations. This
      was more or less a kitchen sink fleet that we threw at the pirates of New Eden.

      Overall a good time was had by all and we spread comradery through the corp while boosting the SoE standings of
      our Signaleers, taking an opportunity while under wardec to go out and have some fun. I myself was able to break
      off some rust while fleet commanding, had been a couple years. In the future we might do so on a monthly basis,
      an idea would be to standardize the composition of the fleet beforehand. And have dedicated logistics and salvage
      if the fleet is large enough.

      Thank you again for the opportunity to create this kind of content, within our community!

      o/ Hey y'all.

      Our attempt at a rep share fleet was a success. I was joined by @Dedalus77 and @Genghis Green.

      We flew our distro ships into low security space, delivering packages for the ever so wonderful reputation
      currency the Sisters of EVE gives. In a collective quest for exploration ships, virtue pod cybernetic
      enhancements, and secrets of J, we spent about two hours chatting, sailing the cosmic winds, and generally being
      little less than uninteresting. Will there be another rep share fleet? I certainly hope so. 🙂

      This was the shortest lead-time fleet (4 days heads up only) that I’ve ever managed to pull off, thanks for the
      great turnout and the solid effort all around.

      Travel was a bit hectic, with 20-something jumps through mostly low-sec, but we made it. Kicked some Sleeper and
      Drifter tuchus and brought back a nice little pile of loot.

      Thanks again for showing up. Looking forward to the next one!

      DPS: @Dude Johnson, @Dedalus77, @Rani Ulfr

      We had randomly decided to do a pickup fleet after speaking with new member @Cloud in chat about content available
      to do, and @Atvas Rotsuda and I had decided to form a Daytrip fleet into Anokis. We formed up fleet at 1145 EVE
      time with an expected departure at 1200 EVE in Zoohen. I undocked and started searching for a suitable subject for
      our content, and found one within two jumps of Zoohen, and it turned out to be a C2 Wormhole, in the next several
      minutes. Inside there was one combat site, 3 forgotten data sites, and two more forgotten relic sites.

      The fleet entered and we started running content, with DPS clearing the grid before the newer members would warp
      in and hack the cans at their convenience. We had one small scare when seeing a Buzzard on D-Scan, which turned
      out to be our own member @Unknown., his ship was promptly renamed. @Atvas Rotsuda had to drop fleet and comms to
      attend to other business within Signal Cartel. Myself, I had passed off FC to @Dude Johnson for a short while so
      I could attend to some IRL business. Upon returning, FC was passed back, and we cleared the remaining 4 sites
      within the wormhole.

      All in all, a great spontaneous fleet, we got some great experience, had some loot and made some ISK. A few
      members had forgone a share which was then donated to Signal Cartel, to benefit new members and exploration.

      Big shout out to all members who came and participated! 10/10 will certainly do again.

      It was a great turnout. We smashed a lot of sleepers. Something like 16 sites, clearing the whole system of combat
      sites. Everyone was patient with me as a green FC (thanks) and we had some first timers. I learned a lot and had
      a lot of fun!

      The 2 logi frigates were more than was necessary, and we discussed possibly doing mixed logi/dps in the future,
      though it does work as a good training ground for future Guardian pilots.

      All told the loot was worth $58,897,551 ISK per pilot. Let me know if you didn't receive it.

    title: "AAR: First Frigate Swarm Fleet"
    organizer: "Lavoleine Audier"
    description: >
      A ragtag team of 21 T1 and T2 frigates and destroyers left Zoohen Station late Thursday (and Friday morning for
      some) to venture into j-space. Our goal was to see how far we could push our little ships into the realm of the
      Sleepers. Our fleet consisted of a Federation Navy Comet, a Punisher, a Rifter, a Tristan, four Retributions, a
      Vengeance, three Wolves (growl!), two Maguses, a Pontifex, a Sentinel, three Deacons, a Thalia, and last but not
      least, a Nemesis.

      I’ll start with the result: we absolutely dominated the Sleepers tonight from C3 to C5 — all without a single
      ship loss. What the Sleepers experienced was exactly what I had envisioned for the fleet: a frigate swarm with a
      sprinkle of destroyers. It wasn’t even a contest; the Sleepers didn’t know what to do with us. We disrupted their
      weapons, webbed them, and blew holes into their ships, all while being supported by a crack logi team that kept
      us healthy and a Sentinel piloted by @Elizbeta Decoherant to keep their guns at bay. On top of that, our salvager
      @Rani Ulfr not only cleaned up the mess we made, but also helped us bookmark perches, navigate wormholes, finding
      a SAR and ultimately get home.

      We completed approximately 14 sites and recovered loot worth about 960 million ISK, which included around 67
      million in salvage. I will donate my share to the SRP, which insured our ships.

      So how did we get here? We started out in Zoohen discussing the use of command destroyer bursts and who would
      handle which type of charge so they wouldn’t stack. We ultimately decided @Rachel Morgan would manage skirmish
      bursts due to his skills, while the remainder ran complementary information and armor bursts. We also discussed
      fleet structure and chose simplicity: logi in one group, everyone else in another. Rachel was assigned XO thanks
      to his fleet experience and excellent combat organization skills.

      We then set out to confront the Sleepers in a C3. Since ad hoc small fleets had already proven successful there,
      we felt upgrading to a C4 would be quick — and it was. As expected, the fleet dominated C3 sites in about six
      minutes (or less) and we soon decided it was time to upgrade. We went next door to a C4 site whose connecting
      wormhole was at end of life. We took the risk of being cut off and plunged forward.

      We warped to our first C4 site, Integrated Terminus, and utterly obliterated it. We pressed on into a Frontier
      Barracks — Obliterating it. Success was becoming routine. We upped the ante with several unsecured sites,
      thinking they’d be a good preview of C5. Again, we crushed them in short order! Our team was unstoppable. The
      only hiccup came in the Unsecured Frontier Digital Nexus, which required a Data Analyzer to spawn the next wave.
      @Rani Ulfr graciously jumped back to k-space to grab the module, brought it back, and I equipped it so we could
      continue our Sleeper demolition.

      At that point, we decided to return to the C3 and enter a connecting shattered C5 Wolf Rayet wormhole — Until
      @Rani Ulfr informed us that the end-of-life wormhole had closed behind us. Cut off, our explorer instincts kicked
      in. @Rani Ulfr scanned down the other static C5, which wasn’t a Wolf Rayet. We hesitated at first, but consensus
      was clear: Push forward. The fleet splashed into the C5.

      @Rani Ulfr set up a perch for a Core Garrison site, but we were missing one fleet member, @Ddado. He showed up
      shortly after, announcing he had “tended the cache” — True Signal Cartel style. We warped in and promptly began
      serving Drifters up on a silver platter. During the second wave, we accidentally spawned the next wave, which
      added three more battleships and eight cruisers. Suddenly, we were facing 6 battleships and a host of cruisers.
      This was our real test. Under the direction of our experienced XO, @Rachel Morgan, we kept calm, maintained
      rhythm, and coordinated target calling to avoid overlapping disruptors and focus fire effectively. Logi worked
      overtime and truly shined — several members dipped into hull (including logi themselves), but the team brought
      them back until the DPS pressure eased. Our lone Sentinel, flown by @Elizbeta Decoherant, also excelled,
      ensuring very few hostile shots landed deeply into armor.

      Without the logi and ewar teams, we would have taken losses — Full stop.

      During our time in the C5, @Rani Ulfr also reported coming upon an SAR. Unprecedented Signal Cartel luck!

      Once the Core Garrison was complete, we considered spawning the Drifter. But without warp scramblers to hold it
      in place, the fleet decided to leave on a high note and head home as it was getting late.

      Of course, while attempting to exit the C5, we learned that @Graphite couldn’t resist. With @Aithra Dreamweaver
      present, they spawned the Drifter and unleashed it. They survived! I would have loved to see that.

      All in all, this fleet was a resounding success; beyond what I had envisioned for our first outing.

      We can credit the doctrine, the consistent discussions about fittings to ensure survivability, the ad hoc fleets
      that proved the concept, the target calling and battlefield organization, the loot logistics and bookmarking, or
      the absolute crack team of pilots who knew their jobs, communicated clearly, and executed brilliantly. I believe
      it was all of the above!

    description: >
      With one successful "light" armor Sleeper frigate fleet op under their belt, the seasoned fleet, 17 in all, 
      departed Theology Council Tribunal Station in Zoohen to test their mettle once again with shield-fitted ships. 
      There was one caveat: the fleet commander was missing. The fleet commander, or, as he fancied calling himself, 
      "FC," "Mr. FC," "The Wonderful FC", had found himself cut off in a wormhole trying to find a way out. 
      Self-destructing was not an option, as the thought of destroying a full set of virtue implants and his beloved 
      Metamorphosis, which had loyally served him for… one week… was far beyond what he could handle.

      After what seemed like an infinite number of scan cycles and wormhole jumps, he finally found k-space. He 
      reported to the fleet that the C5s and the backups he had planned to use were cut off and not reliably 
      accessible. Rani, a rock star, came through with a C4 and possible C5 connection a short distance from Zoohen 
      — the backup of the backup plan saved the day!

      The FC finally arrived in Zoohen and, after a long-winded speech about "how not to die" and "how not to get 
      him killed" 🫶, the fleet departed.

      Since this was the fleet's first outing with shield-fitted ships, they decided to attempt a few C4 sites. The 
      FC knew all along the doctrine was solid and they should immediately jump to a C5, but he acquiesced and forged 
      ahead to C4 sites.

      In typical Frigate Swarm fashion, supported by the crack team of logistics pilots, the fleet lambasted the 
      Sleepers in their beds with missiles, lasers, and every type of projectile known to Signaleers - They didn't 
      stand a chance. It was trivial, to say the least, and the FC knew the fleet needed more. After romping through 
      two sites, the fleet quickly decided to jump into a C5 that Artenac had scouted. It was a vanilla C5, meaning 
      there were no bonuses to our ships or fleet. It did not matter — Sleepers were no match for this fleet.

      With a renewed sense of confidence and fervor, the fleet ran through the Core Stronghold unimpeded — it was 
      glorious. After completing the site, the fleet decided to spawn the Drifter. That poor Drifter didn't know what 
      hit him as he literally spun in circles trying to find a way out. After what seemed like an eternity and a 
      constant barrage of explosions and light, the Drifter met its demise.

      Artenac, the trusty scout whose always finding new ways to test the fleet, advised the team there was an 
      Unsecured Frontier Enclave Relay. This site is an upgraded C5, and some say it is a preview of what we will see 
      in a C6. The team immediately accepted the challenge and warped to the site.

      Again, the Frigate Swarm found the site tougher but still manageable. Then the unthinkable happened: 
      Strelnikova lost his ship, the most cherished and best looking ship in his hangar. It happened in the blink of 
      an eye. The Sleepers somehow had a stroke of luck and hit his ship with wrecking shots. There was so little 
      time and not enough rep to offset the immense damage Strel's ship was taking. The fleet completed the site on a 
      somber note.

      Having been hit, Strel decided to backtrack his pod to k-space. That was when he told us he had been podded by 
      a Nighthawk camping a wormhole en route back.

      Artenac and Rani confirmed the presence of a Nighthawk as well as a fleet a few holes from the way the fleet 
      had come. Moreover, the entrance wormhole had collapsed. With the fleet's exit cut off and a threatening fleet 
      nearby, there was no choice but to move forward and find another exit. Artenac and Rani, the heroes of the 
      hour and in Signal Cartel style, found the way out.

      All in all, the fleet was successful, once again proving that big things come in small packages. They retrieved 
      760,000,000 ISK in blue loot and 57,190,716 ISK in salvage, for a grand total of 817,190,716 ISK with each 
      share being 46,051,100 ISK.

      With Strelnikova's loss, it was a reminder to the fleet that while frigates are agile and highly effective, 
      they are also extremely fragile - and that true camaraderie and teamwork emerge when things are at their worst. 
      And one more thing: What happens in wormholes stays in wormholes… except for the AAR!

      Technical Notes:
      - DPS felt a little lacking. Site clearance was not as quick as with the armor fit.
      - EWAR tracking disruption was under-represented. It's a key component - if there is a decision to use a 
        painter or web, select a tracking disruptor! All battleships should have at least one disruption.
      - Coordinate and callout the disruption of battleships over comms to ensure full coverage.
      - Shield logi fits need to be reworked to increase their overall EHP to withstand wrecking shots especially in 
        C5 and above. Isaac is already on the task.
      - Command destroyers need refit and backup burst modules in the event a core fleet member becomes temporarily 
        unavailable. Thanks Rani!
      - Consider longer range weapons for ships that can fit them thereby being possible to increase DPS average. 
        Thanks Rachel!
      - Consider shield amplifiers in shield fits as they are not dependent on cap and will continue to function if 
        capped out. Thanks Artenac for the tip!

      The day started out as any other, sleeper bashing in the usual swarm fleet fashion; it was anything but. The 
      fleet entered the C5 and started with a Quarantine Area site. It went extremely smooth per usual. At the end 
      of the site, the fleet decided to spawn the drifter. After several minutes, the drifter inexplicably warped 
      off. Unfortunately we had only 3 points of scram instead of the required 4 points.

      We d-scanned and could not find it at one of the wormholes. One fleet member checked one hole and didn't find 
      him. There was a low sec connection that was outside of our d-scan range. The FC decided to warp to the hole 
      at 100 km, see if he was there, then warp off. Bad idea. Upon exiting warp, drifter was present and 
      immediately scrammed, neuted and began blasting him. By the time the fleet warped in, the FC was a pile of 
      space debris. The FC gave fleet command to Rachel Morgan and headed to k-space to reship and rejoin the fight. 
      The fleet then began another Quarantine Area site. Here is the account of the AAR according to Rachel:

      At the safe the fleet decided to run a second Quarantine Area site identical to the first that was run. We set 
      up at perch, and discussed the opening of the attack on the sleepers, after the first Argos turret was 
      destroyed the second wave spawned in. Being a random trigger site, it was possible to happen. We worked the 
      targets best we could, until all turrets were gone and most frigates. There were 3 Sleepless Sentinel 
      battleships that were on grid, we called targets to clear out the neut pressure from them. The interim FC 
      changed priority from the farther battleship to one nearer. And after it popped the third wave spawned on the 
      grid. I had made a mistake in tracking which Sleepless Sentinels were from wave 2 and wave 1. We destroyed 
      both from the second spawning the last wave! With elements from 3 waves on the grid we started to become 
      overwhelmed.

      Our valiant logistics pilots and EWAR operator were working double time to keep the fleet as healthy as 
      possible. The first to fall in battle was Lingus Khan in his Kitsune, jamming the enemy. Next were Dude 
      Johnson and Rani Ulfr, whose Kirin logistics frigates could not keep each other healthy enough against the 
      onslaught. As it happened so quickly, FC realized the entire fleet was at risk of not only being combat 
      ineffective, but being completely wiped out. FC called the fleet to quit the grid and warp off to safe.

      Two pilots, Rachel Morgan and Sir Fiddle Sticks were unable to warp off the grid, as we were webbed and warp 
      scrambled. Sir Fiddle went down fighting to the end, taking Sleepers down as his blaster fit Harpy was brought 
      low and destroyed. Rachel Morgan, in a Bifrost Command Destroyer was trying to take one more down and spamming 
      warp the whole while, after Sir Fiddle was brought low. The sleepers dropped the webs and warp scramblers, 
      allowing Rachel to warp off the grid and rejoin the fleet at safe spot. Both Dude Johnson and Sir Fiddle 
      Sticks chose the Jita Express for their pods to reship while Rani Ulfr chose to exit the wormhole and fly back 
      to reship.

      Being non-combat operational without the logistics squad any longer, Rachel Morgan had the fleet quit Anokis 
      space, and retreat to the lowsec entry system to await returning members. Lavoleine, Dude Johnson, Rani Ulfr, 
      Sir Fiddle Sticks, and late comer to the fleet Connor met the remainder of the fleet at the lowsec station in 
      Menai.

      Fleet command was returned to Lavoleine: The fleet was still in high spirits knowing the losses were but a 
      glitch in what can otherwise be described as sleeper domination. Once the remaining ships arrived in Menai 
      station, the fleet jumped back into j-space to continue with the Quarantine Area site that had caused the 
      losses. In frigate swarm style, the sleepers were not a match and the site was completed without incident. The 
      fleet decided to no longer spawn the drifter due to the time and ammo required to dispatch the battleship - It 
      was just not practical.

      Since this site was a C5 shattered system, the fleet decided to attempt two C6 sites for the first time - The 
      Core Citadel. Per Sir Fiddle Sticks these were the easier of the C6 sites as the enemy does not scram and the 
      fleet could escape if needed. Two of these sites were run and completed in just over 30 minutes per Rachel's 
      estimation, proving that the frigate swarm fleet could engage some of the hardest wormhole content. At that 
      time, the team decided to head to k-space and home.

      The loot recovered was 1,025,000,000 and share to each pilot is 49,097,500. Moreover, all modules recovered 
      from Signaleers' wrecks have been contracted back to the corresponding pilots.

      The fleet embarked on its mission, endured adversity along the way, and emerged stronger than ever having 
      vanquished their first C6-level sites. A powerful testament to the determination, passion, and talent of all 
      who serve within it.

      Technical Analysis:
      - The fleet's losses serve as a reminder that frigates are more vulnerable and operate with a more narrow 
        margin for error than larger ships.
      - Logistics crew kept their reps sharp, maintaining our combat readiness throughout the entire session.
      - One big change this session is EWAR (both ECM and tracking disrupted) were better represented in this fleet. 
        The team coordinated the application of tracking disruption to ensure full coverage on all battleships. ECM 
        jamming provided by Lingus was invaluable as on a few occasions was able to break target locks as well as 
        continuous jamming of major threat. Per Lingus, ECM jamming was not successful on the drifter battleship.
      - DPS squad performed admirably with The C1eansing's Draugr being the DPS leader with having dealt 1,085,583 
        in damage - Truly amazing.
      - Specifically for frigate swarm, we are deciding to skip drifter spawning at the end of the sites due to time 
        and ammo required.
      - Note to me: Don't go looking for a Drifter alone as he's not very good company!!!

      To quote @RedSquared: "Splashed WHs, went pew pew, got blue loot, FC got primaried by accident, logi did 
      great and dude was as handsome as ever, we got home safe."

      We ran 8 C6 sites in total, including 5 Core Citadel anoms (with Drifters), 1 Forgotten Core Circuitry 
      Disassembler relic site, 1 Unsecured Core Emergence data site, and 1 Strange Energy Readings anom (with 
      Drifter), in that order. Loot came out to 4,247,806,658 ISK after taxes, with blue loot making up 
      3,619,089,375 of that and salvage contributing the remaining 628,717,283. I'm including relic and data loot 
      in "salvage" since it was unfortunately negligible (something like 30mil total). Payouts came out to 
      184,687,246 per pilot.

      The route in was a bit interesting, involving a perfectly timed Thera jump, several wormhole connections 
      through low and null, and a shattered C6. We weren't bothered at any point while traveling or running sites, 
      though we were mildly inconvenienced by a nice return Thera hole collapsing before we reached it.

      Despite it not being necessary, there was a popular request that I do an AAR for the fleet, which was rather 
      interesting.

      Site Count: A lot. I think like 17 total? I lost count.
      Duration: 5 hours
      Loot: 840M. I think. I hope.

      We started out in Zoohen slightly delayed, mostly because FC had just gotten home and was quickly distracted 
      by having to move stuff from a freeport that was under attack. This meant he wasn't able to scout out a 
      suitable wormhole, so thankfully everyone jumped in and quickly found a great C3 with somewhere around 20 
      sites, and even better the entrance was only 1 jump away from Zoo.

      The original roster was Dude, Lav, and FC, but we were quickly (before we'd even started) joined by Rachel 
      who also offered to scout and salvage with Noctis on an alt. We ran a few sites rather uneventfully before we 
      were joined by Huckleberry. This made the FC a little too cocky thinking we had enough people, and so he 
      proceeded to warp everyone to the perch for a Forgotten Frontier Quarantine Outpost. Except it wasn't the 
      perch, it was the site itself, and due to extreme unpreparedness, the FC promptly got blapped off the field 
      while everyone else warped out. The night's first and only loss.

      This was a rather odd fleet. It started out relatively normal, other than that good C3s ceased to exist for 
      about an hour while we searched for one, which delayed the fleet significantly. Finally we decided to run the 
      C3 we did find, despite it only having a few sites. And after running a single site, it turned out there was a 
      shattered C4 with a good mix of C3 and C4 sites right next door.

      So we hopped through, and ran a few more Forgotten Frontier Strongholds to warm up a little, and then decided 
      to run a Frontier Barracks. It went reasonably well until it didn't, which in this case meant Dizzy getting 
      primaried and heavily neuted in the second wave leading to violent deconstruction.

      Thankfully we were able to finish the site, and thanks to Lav loaning him a Vagabond, Dizzy was able to 
      quickly get back into the fray.

      We then started another Frontier Barracks site, slightly more cautiously, which paid off as no one died, or 
      even got into hull.

      But then as we're chilling on the site waiting for the MTU, a Sabre pops up on d-scan. And like 30 seconds 
      later pops up on grid. And 10 seconds after that throws up bubbles. Anticipating a large fleet coming in, 
      everyone started trying to slowboat out of the bubble to warp off grid, while also yellowboxing the Sabre. 
      Which was going okay, until a Tengu showed up.

      Why he dropped is something all of us asked, as there were 4 HACs/T3Cs on grid as well as two assault 
      frigates, and even though we were 'PVE' fit, we were C3/C4 sleeper PVE fit and there was 6 of us against one 
      Tengu. Regardless, the order to target the Tengu was given, and shots were fired. The Tengu was ridiculously 
      fast though, since it had an Abyssal rolled 100mn AB, making it tricky to hit. But we had a Loki with webs, 
      and as soon as those were on target, it was slowed down enough that everyone else could pile, webbing it down 
      even more, and giving it a wee good kicking. https://zkillboard.com/kill/130116346/ On a side note I'm still 
      slightly miffed we didn't get the abyssals that dropped 😠 thankfully they didn't get them either 😄

      What's really weird, is there was at least one time he could've warped out, but chose not to. Caught up in the 
      moment, or maybe surprised the peaceful explorers can fight back.

      Once he was down, and since the Sabre's bubbles had despawned as well, we were finally able to escape, warping 
      back to the C3, and then in turn Zoohen dock up.

      Everyone stepped away, took a deep breath, and then handed their combat logs to FC because paperwork gah. 
      After chilling out for half an hour or so, everyone was ready to go out again, though this time in frigates. 
      The chain we had gone down was deemed unfit for further usage, so everyone started scouting for another C3, 
      this time heading into lowsec as well. And of course, we find two at the same time. Flipping a coin, we hopped 
      in. This time the hole was quiet, and we ran sites in solitude. Everything was well, except for Huckleberry 
      having the absolute worst luck and getting either neuted, webbed and DPSed into the ground, or just straight up 
      alphaed in half a second. But he persisted, and came back both times, which is bloody awesome. I think most of 
      us would quit after the second death, especially one that feels so unfair.

      But after that everything kinda settled into a routine, with the scariest moment happening while running a 
      Forgotten Frontier Quarantine Outpost and everyone had to take turns warping off. That site has some scary DPS 
      application, especially the first wave with 6 frigates that all have webs.

      Wunderbar fleet, it was much fun, and the first time I've seen Jacinto Manso which was nice. Like 15 sites ran 
      and some 700ish mil I think, as well as much yapping in comms which is half the reason to join lel.

      Dear Signaleers :o7pup:,

      The 10th Trip Tik Guided Tour was quite an adventure!

      Lots of amazing sights were seen, plenty of lore was learned and a lot of fun was shared.

      We were chased for a rather long part of the way but our scouts kept us informed of dangers ahead as well as 
      behind, so we managed to finish the tour with only one buzzard loss, destroyed at our first site by some 
      sleepers, which didn't prevent @Atreus Tristar to continue valiantly in their pod.

      We got chased most of the way across gate jumps by various shuttle hunters. Kikimoras, Slicers, Sabres, 
      Praxis, combat probes... Plenty of company on D-scan and at gates to keep us on our toes!

      We kept dodging and eluding the chase all the way by making good use of the intel provided by our scouts, 
      moving fast, jumping between safes, staying aligned when on sites, etc.

      At some point we witnessed one of the many fights occurring between sleepers and either Triglavians or 
      EDENCOM, quite a sight as well.

      Many thanks to all attendees, with special mentions to our Guide, @Strelnikova for the brilliant storytelling 
      and to our scouts for perfect anticipation and intel gathering, we made it through thanks to them!

      Well, that was quite the successfully unsuccessful fleet.

      During setup, I lost sight of the fact that I didn't entirely know what I was doing—mainly with sentry drones 
      and their quirks.

      EVE, like most games, is made by imperfect people for imperfect people, so the occasional oddity is to be 
      expected.

      Long story short: while sentry drones don't move and stay within 2,000m when deployed from a stationary ship 
      and their range is affected by a scripted Omnidirectional Tracking Link, they still won't engage targets 
      outside your drone control range. That range needs to match the target range.

      So in a way, the fleet was a complete success, in exposing a flaw in the fit. Which brings us to the 
      provisional fit for the upcoming Spider Fleet:

      Firstly, thanks to everyone who could make it, turns out we had the perfect turnout to run a proof of concept.

      With seven people in the fleet, we were able to form two wings of three, giving us two solid and 
      straightforward cap chains, with myself in an Eos providing command bursts.

      We ran a trial site in a C3 on the way to our target destination, which proved far too easy. Unfortunately, 
      we also stirred up the locals, the launch of a Praxis encouraged us to move on.

      At the destination C4, the first two sites went smoothly, aside from the brief appearance of a Proteus on 
      D-scan.

      But he was probably just passing through, right? Feeling optimistic, we pressed on to the next site, only to 
      have a fly drop into the ointment, or more accurately, a Flycatcher and all his friends.

      Long story short, we lost six out of the seven ships. On the bright side, @Dude Johnson wasn't primary and 
      managed to escape with his ship, wonders will never cease.

      Aside from a small TP friendly-fire incident, there's not much else to report. The fleet was great fun, and 
      I'll be running it again, hopefully in a better location, and with maybe a scout along for the ride.

      PS. If anybody can use a replacement ship, I have 4x sitting in Zoo looking for a good home...

      LP for ships and parts.

      We spent three hours blitzing missions, having laughs, and generally making sure New Eden is safe from those 
      pesky pirates. Loot was available for salvage, collection, and use. All mission rewards of ISK/rep/LP was 
      shared to the group, and Fritte was practicing his Leroy skills. SRP was available, but not needed.

      There will be more fleets to come this week, so please be on the lookout in Alliance chat and by some

      Fleet Purpose: To spread Halloween hugs

      The fleet departed on time and set off for Jita, spreading hugs along the way with notable stops in and 
      around Uedama. After that, we went in search of some low-sec adventure and did our best to offer a few warm 
      embraces to a lone Tristan orbiting The Solitaire.

      To bring our fleet to a fitting conclusion, we headed to Abazone, where the intensity of our hugs proved 
      overwhelming for the gate campers, who after a few single losses, eventually gave up and sat back to watch the 
      show.

      The fleet then disbanded and everyone returned to their individual shenanigans.

      Lessons Learned: Hugs are mighty.

      Future Directions: More hugs.

      Just another quick impromptu fleet to farm SoE loyalty points and bring up standing with the Sisters before we 
      all buy that new SoE battlecruiser. All went well. As usual, I turned up in a blingy-looking Cerberus and 
      pretty much everyone else turned up in a much more blingy battleship or marauder 😄.

      These ad-hoc fleets are fun and it was good to hear someone (sorry didn't see who it was) say that these level 
      4 missions were usually boring, but a lot more fun with friends - I totally agree. We cleared these missions in 
      single digit minutes and it was definitely fun.

      I would ask that peeps who might not be skilled into combat ships come along next time in salvager/looting 
      ships - you will join in the fun, pick up a pile of good stuff we were leaving behind and join in on the 
      standings bonus, etc.

      Greetings all!

      On this day the members of Signal Cartel made a decision to spread happiness to New Eden's citizens.

      The fleet visited Steve, EVE Online's first Avatar class Titan.

      Using our Turnur hub, we were followed by a local Interdictor from Null space to our hub. The Interdictor 
      pilot gave one of our members an early journey home. With our lost pilot's blessing, the fleet continued.

      With one instance of FC incompetence, our fleet was warped to the wrong wormhole, and split. We regrouped 
      without problem, and headed off.

      Our eventual destination was Goonswarm Federation's home staging area [redacted].

      A tense journey of 16 jumps through Null space was had before finally arriving and going "Hugs Free" on the 
      main keepstar.

      Local chat was tame, and the members of SC conducted themselves with grace and humility, as was anticipated. 
      These pilots really are an amazing representation of who SC is.

      A quick set of hugs was thrown before locals reminded us their home system was in-fact NOT a wormhole. Assuming 
      we got confused, they gave us a complementary pod express back to Zoohen where we regrouped.

      A large thank you to @Dizzy Dorasdottir for their wonderful organization, to @Torquay for providing ships and 
      SKINS, to @Noeme Hucel-Ge for making safe spots, and to @Nerialka for their excellent scouting ability!

      Great job folks, this was an all-hands job.

      Please post any pictures you took, or feel free to share your stories.

      Though this fleet format offers the least ISK/hour and runs at a massive loss, it delivers the most fun/hour 
      for me.

      Watch for Spider Fleet 3...

      Departure was nearly on time with 6x logi and 1x command ship, joined by @Graphite in his Odysseus (details 
      later).

      Somewhere along the line @Karina Ohu joined the fleet but didn't make it onto my watchlist as did @Atvas 
      Rotsuda.

      As Atvas was not added to the watchlists he did not receive any reps becoming our 1st casualty.

      We cruised through the available anomalies, even the more difficult ones.

      So because YOLO, I decided to attempt a combat signature, because that has never gone wrong before! We would 
      have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those pesky kids and their 4 scramming BSs!

      The logi could just not hold and we started falling like domino's. Trying to save what we could the fleet cold 
      warped out leaving our MTU and wrecks behind.

      But wait, that is not all, this is where we come back to @Graphite and his ill fated Odysseus warping back in 
      with the firm belief of being slippery enough to be able to retrieve the abandoned MTU.

      Spoilers, it didn't quite work out https://zkillboard.com/kill/131594220/

      Thank you all for coming, and hope you will join me on the next one where hopefully some of the lessons learned 
      will be applied.

      When @Dry Baby proposed a Signal Cartel Flotilla of pure Sisters of EVE vessels to gather around Katia Sae's 
      monument in Saisio, there was only one possible answer: "Present!" And I wasn't the only one. Signaleers from 
      every corner of New Eden answered the call, even a quiet, shadowed figure who rarely reveals their presence 
      drifted at the edge of the formation, watching. 👀

      When the fleet time arrived, Sisters ships of every type glided into orbit around the monument. Some took 
      graceful arcs around the great stone hand rising from the heavens, others perched close as if whispering 
      admiration to the statue itself. More and more signaleers warped in, loading their launchers with hugs, love, 
      and fireworks.

      Then it happened.

      A shimmer above the monument. A ripple of cloak distortion. And on top of the hand itself, an Odysseus 
      materialized, elegant, serene, unmistakable.

      Katia Sae herself had joined the flotilla!

      She opened the celebration by firing hugs directly at her own statue, a poetic gesture of gratitude and 
      humility. The fleet erupted in answer, a synchronized volley of affection as twenty Signaleers lit the sky. 
      Fireworks blossomed across the void, bright enough that anyone entering Saisio through the stargate would be 
      momentarily blinded by a storm of color and goodwill.

      The monument glowed in the radiance of all that love, twenty Signaleers, one legend, and an ocean of light.

      A beautiful, joyful event. One to remember.

      Thank you for your participation!

      Well, it had to happen again sooner or later. A fleet with minimal drama (other than the FC warping in solo), 
      plus a last-minute scramble for implants to fix a slight fitment miscalculation 😊.

      I guess the third time really is the charm!

      Honestly, the most stressful part of the fleet was the 24-jump trip to and from the system, half of which ran 
      through active low-sec. With BoB smiling on us, even that went smoothly.

      In hindsight, I think the Navy 🐔 and 🦃 were overkill. For Spider 4, we'll be reverting back to T1 Birds.

      If you've kept any of the MNI (as I asked) go ahead and scrap them and build T1s for Spider 4. Fit TBD.

      Special thanks to @Dizzy Dorasdottir for finding such a great system and providing navigation to get us there!

      A fun way to say goodbye to 2025. The fleet ran smooth and easy, reached the destination without issue, and 
      started ripping into the sleepers with almost boring ease.

      To spice things up, we decided to tackle the more difficult content, content that had proven fatal in the 
      past, namely an Unsecured Core Backup Array.

      With that in mind, losing only a single ship in the first two waves and a single logi in the third wave was a 
      brilliant achievement.

      Unfortunately, the loss of the logi put paid to any attempt at continuing the third wave. Could we have run it 
      anyway? Maybe, but we'll never know until we try again one day.

      Thanks to everyone who made it, and to those who tried to make it.
