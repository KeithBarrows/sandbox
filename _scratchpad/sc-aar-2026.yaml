      Well that went as well as could be hoped for. We came, we saw we kicked hiney. Would love to go into some 
      elaborate description of what happened, but am a bit distracted.

      So I'll do what I normally never do, discuss ISK! Together with salvage we managed to get an estimated 3.9B 
      ISK, which once everything is sold and after deductions and taxes still allows for a tidy payday.

      As usual thanks to all that could partake and those who tried to.
    ISK: 3900000000
    ISK per Pilot: 278571429

    title: "AAR: T2 Spider Fleet"
    organizer: "Sir Fiddle Sticks"
    description: >
      Another textbook fleet under the belt, we came we saw and we took their lunch money,

      Which is dangerous as it encourages us to risk even more in the pursuit of Fun/Hour min maxing.

      So before we carry on with planning the next Spider fleet I'd like some feedback.

      a) What worked for you in the setup.
      b) What didn't work for you in the setup.
      c) How often did you use 2, 3, 4 repairers at a time?
      d) Did you have to overheat modules and how often?
      e) Did it rub you the wrong way that we had to bypass the drifter?
      f) Do you miss the cap-chain?

      There are a lot of ways forward on this Spider web, the above will help me in the eternal quest to maximise 
      the Fun/hour on these fleets.

      Thanks for coming along and having fun.
