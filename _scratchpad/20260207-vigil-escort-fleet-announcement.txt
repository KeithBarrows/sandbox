We’ve had a unique request from the New Eden community which you can see here: ⁠public-sc-questions⁠

I’ve been talking with them and what they have in mind is exactly what I was hoping for as this will be setting a precedent going forward. Our services are centered around what we do for one, we must be able to do for all equally. In that spirit, this will be our standard when memorials are requested by the New Eden community. 

(Work in progress) Signal Cartel can provide a private memorial fleet for capsuleers who have passed. This service won’t be advertised, but it will be available if we’re asked.

The memorial fleet will form up and depart from Zoohen with the destination being the Capsuleer Memorial in Molea. The memorial fleet will provide fireworks and services can be done by the requestor or one of our Signaleers.

Notes:
Ascension of Light schedule 1200, 1800, and 2400 EVE Time (confirming)
Cans anchored within 200km will not disappear

With all of that in mind, our first community requested escort.
