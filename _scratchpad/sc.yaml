      The third Trip Tik Guided Tour went very well thanks to our Guide, @Jen Hoshi
      who introduced us to magnificent views of Minmatar Space and led us to discover
      interactive Trip Tik sites!
      Our scout helped to clear one of them from the little rat that lives there so we
      could jump the acceleration gate safely, thanks a lot @Strelnikova!
      Another special mention for the effort of all the attendees who brought a large
      motley crew of rust-and-duct-tape ships. The fleet was a sight in itself!

      We came, we conquered, got dropped on and called it a night.
      Overall a fun little fleet cut short just as it was starting to have fun.
      Will have to make some plans for next time we have party crashers to keep the fun going.
      I have an idea, more to follow later.
      Thanks for the great turnout and hope you all had as much fun as I did.

      The fourth Trip Tik Guided Tour went very well thanks to our Guide, @Strelnikova
      who lead us through a brilliant storytelling in Gallente space during which we
      learned a lot about their culture and history but also about New Eden as a whole
      with the visit of the Seyllin system.

      Our scout helped to keep us safe in the LS systems, thanks a lot @Dizzy Dorasdottir!

      @Strelnikova even jumped to take lead of the fleet as RL called me out to take care
      of my little one. Well done, comrade :o7pup:.

      Thanks as well to all attendees who gathered a nice variety of Gallente ships.

    organizer: "Arachnis"
    description: >
      This was the first fleet with the new "Heavy Shield" battlecruiser doctrine, in a C6 magnetar to boot.
      It was certainly engaging; let's put it that way. 😛

      We ran 2 anomalies very quickly, including drifters. The main strength of this shield setup over armor is
      certainly its raw firepower. Sleepers and drifters alike crumbled like wet paper. Unfortunately, 2 Basis
      weren't quite enough to handle the incoming damage from a C6 relic site, and we lost both our logi in the
      last wave. @Dude Johnson and @Strelnikova both put up a heroic effort, even somehow managing to save my
      Cenotaph mid-hull. Sadly, no amount of effort can beat simple math. To run C6 relics safely with this
      doctrine and likely the armor version as well, 3 logi are needed (datas and anoms are easier).

      Unable to run sites with no logi, we evacuated the system to regroup and reship. Bob wasn't done entertaining
      Himself yet: our exit wormhole into the C2 leading back to HS collapsed right as the fleet was jumping through
      it, leaving some members stranded, though they simply scanned down the new C2 static and got a HS connection
      in a system right next to our old one. After people reshipped, we went back in and right back out after I made
      a bad target call in a Core Bastion and accidentally spawned the next wave early. Oops!

      All that said, we still made out with 1,559,999,354 ISK in loot, coming out to 74,285,683 per pilot. Thank you
      @Graphite for the consistently great looting work, and thank you everyone for coming!

      I'm pleased to report that this fleet was painless and even a bit boring. We ran 7 sites in total in a C6
      magnetar with no losses, though there was a close call in a The Mirror [sic]. Finding a decent connection took
      quite some time, though I suppose that's the tradeoff of not being bothered by anyone.

      A total of 19 pilots participated, with 2 first-timers and 3 more second-timers. Loot totaled to 3,403,175,509
      ISK, for 179,114,500 ISK per member. Thank you logi for keeping us alive, and thank you @Graphite for scanning
      us a way out after our HS connection collapsed. Only possible fit adjustment at the moment is adding MWDs to
      more ships unless people have other ideas. Thank you for coming, and if you didn't get paid, please let me know
      ASAP.

      trivias and challenges at Choonka's Diner. Questions were asked, dice were rolled and dirty ships were cleaned
      up.

      @Tamayo was generous with gifts of all sorts and we all had a lot of fun 🙂

      Thanks a lot @Nihaan Kumar who scouted the way through the LS jumps.

      And of course, thanks to all attendees who gathered a nice variety of dirty ships.

      Hello. It's me, mediocre pilot and conman Arachnis. You're probably wondering why I'm standing here in the Zoohen
      hangar in front of this Pacifier spinning on a turntable like at a trade show and speaking in this deep calming
      voice that invokes a sense of trust.

      It's because I want to talk to you about FedoWow! You'll be saying Wow! when you get a look at FedoWow! It's a
      fedo! It's a sponge! It's a zkill link! A regular wet towel will brick your Astero, but not FedoWow! Order now
      and I'll throw in a second FedoWow! absolutely free plus shipping and handling. But wait, there's more! Call in
      the next 20 minutes and you too can enjoy a nice 3,340,602,247 ISK loot total, coming out to 238,614,446 ISK per
      pilot. 13 pilots participated in total, including 3 first-timers. We ran 7 sites, sticking to Core Citadels along
      with Drifter bashing due to only having 2 logi. Thank you logi for keeping us alive, and thank you to everyone
      who participated! If you didn't get paid (FedoWOW! sold separately), please let me know ASAP.

      This fleet went off flawlessly, with 14 pilots including 1 first-timer running 9 sites (plus drifters) for a loot
      total of 4,348,752,636 ISK, coming out to 289,916,842 per pilot. No ships were lost, though a few hits made it
      into armor and were quickly cleaned up by @Dude Johnson and @Lixiana Vor'shan on logi.

      I'll try a minor order-of-operations change for the next fleet: instead of bashing each site's drifter after
      running that site, we'll run sites in pairs: clear the second site, then warp directly to the first site's
      drifter spawn and kill it, then do the same for the second site. This'll remove the awkwardness of needing to
      pilot around the huge pancake structure to get back to the drifter spawn location for every site.

      Thank you to everyone who participated in this fleet, especially the 2 logi pilots, and thank you @Graphite for
      scanning a HS exit and salvaging for us! If you didn't get paid, please let me know ASAP.

      This fleet was ever so slightly larger than the last one, with 18 pilots including 2 first-timers. We ran 9 sites,
      including 7 anomalies and 2 data sites, for a loot total of 5,317,130,170 ISK, coming out to 295,396,120 per pilot.
      We lost one Confessor to alpha damage in a data site, despite the noble efforts of our logi.

      Unfortunately, the revised Drifter timing strategy isn't viable due to the sites themselves despawning so much
      faster than expected.

      Thank you to everyone who participated, especially our 3 logi of @Dude Johnson @Isaac Apylon and @Strelnikova.

    description: >
      Today @Strelnikova @Aurelia @Troden Treadwell and @Woolpolecat formed up a fleet in Zoohen to clear SoF AIR
      program at 12:30 EVE.

      Our goal was to clear all the not self-clearable SoF perks:
      https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/AIR_Career_Program#Soldier_of_Fortune
      This has been done following:
      https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Signal_Cartel_Friendly_Fire_Guide

      A total of 750 Career Points (CP) is required
      Everyone can reach by him/herself a total of 360 CP by completing, under SoF tree:
      Career Agent Missions (100 CP);
      Social (85 CP);
      Combat (90 CP);
      Destruction (85 CP);

      So we needed at least 390 more CP to get to a total minimum of 750 CP.
      We cleared these perks:
      Capacitor Warfare: Neut and drain the given amounts of capacitor from another players ship (120 CP);
      Electronic Warfare: Use different types of Electronic Warfare for 300 seconds each on other player's ships. (100 CP);
      Duels: Participate in the given number of duels. You can have duels with several players at once but only one open
      duel invitation. (75 CP).
      Support: Remote repair given amounts of shields/armor of another player's ship. (100 CP).

      We used our Zoohen Office's provisions.

      Every T1 frig was fitted only with HS, MS and Drones.
      Heron is particularly effective for its 5 Mid Slots (space for every mid mod you need: web, painter, w scram, w
      disrupt and weapon disrupt).
      Drones are useful because you will need to chew on other's shields and armor (you can't rep them if those are
      full) and you don't have turrets or launcher fitted to make space to neuts, nosfy and/or armor and shield reppers
      (that should be fitted along with batteries to help with little cap).
      A minimum of one refit was is required to clear all perks.

      Everything went well except an accidental kill on @Troden Treadwell operated by @Woolpolecat's too excited drones
      https://zkillboard.com/kill/127514601/
      @Aldar Roanaok I'm available for any clarification on the occurred accident.

    description: >
      This was the sequel to Bring Out Your Drake, but now in an even nicer neighbourhood, a C5 shattered magnetar.

      It gave us a nice, chill bit of ratting, generating around 4B ISK, I think, did the math using my fingers and toes. 🙄

      The only real bits of excitement came from our own quirks, inexperience and, dare I say, hubris.

      We had one pilot lost along the way, mainly due to the brain fog I was operating under. I just couldn't keep track
      of everyone, and once it became clear we had lost someone, I didn’t have the mental acuity to figure out how, when,
      or come up with a way to fix it.

      On the next fleet, I plan to tether @Infotropy to my ship to make sure we don’t lose him again! 😄

      We ran a number of sites (it’s all a blur now), some say six, some say more.
      The only one I clearly remember is the one where some buffoon forgot to scram the Drifter, resulting in a bit of a
      chase around the system.

      Somewhere towards the end of proceedings I was fast running out of steam and to I'm sure some relief, voice. Thanks
      @Arachnis for stepping in and trying to shot call totally random tagging.

      The only bit of excitement on the way back to Zoo was provided by @Graphite, who I presume, for the same reason moths
      are drawn to a flame, decided to return to a gate camp to keep an eye on it, and got fried, just like the moth. 🔥🦋

      Either way, not too boring a trip, and one I feel may be worth repeating.

      We had formed the fleet up at 1800 EVE time and got underway, blitzing missions with 7 members. All was an
      overwhelming show of force on the poor pirates of EVE, our only loss was No Math who became primary during an
      attempt to rescue a Damsel in Distress! His Maller was unable to withstand the newly arrived pleasure garden
      forces who took out their aggression on him. He promptly reshipped into a Coercer for salvage operations. This
      was more or less a kitchen sink fleet that we threw at the pirates of New Eden.

      Overall a good time was had by all and we spread comradery through the corp while boosting the SoE standings of
      our Signaleers, taking an opportunity while under wardec to go out and have some fun. I myself was able to break
      off some rust while fleet commanding, had been a couple years. In the future we might do so on a monthly basis,
      an idea would be to standardize the composition of the fleet beforehand. And have dedicated logistics and salvage
      if the fleet is large enough.

      Thank you again for the opportunity to create this kind of content, within our community!

      The time Coffee Time Talk ended we wiped out the entire belt!

      Then I had to log off and leader was passed to @Rachel Morgan (thank you for helping me with burst and... for the
      Orca for it is awesome to see around).

      I know we had a Venture loss for @John Milne due to a nasty diamond Blood rat.

      Thank you all for the nice chilling on the belt!

      o/ Hey y'all.

      Our attempt at a rep share fleet was a success. I was joined by @Dedalus77 and @Genghis Green.

      We flew our distro ships into low security space, delivering packages for the ever so wonderful reputation
      currency the Sisters of EVE gives. In a collective quest for exploration ships, virtue pod cybernetic
      enhancements, and secrets of J, we spent about two hours chatting, sailing the cosmic winds, and generally being
      little less than uninteresting. Will there be another rep share fleet? I certainly hope so. 🙂

      This was the shortest lead-time fleet (4 days heads up only) that I’ve ever managed to pull off, thanks for the
      great turnout and the solid effort all around.

      Travel was a bit hectic, with 20-something jumps through mostly low-sec, but we made it. Kicked some Sleeper and
      Drifter tuchus and brought back a nice little pile of loot.

      Thanks again for showing up. Looking forward to the next one!

      Hacking/Scouts: @Cloud, @Unknown.

      DPS: @Dude Johnson, @Dedalus77, @Rani Ulfr

      We had randomly decided to do a pickup fleet after speaking with new member @Cloud in chat about content available
      to do, and @Atvas Rotsuda and I had decided to form a Daytrip fleet into Anokis. We formed up fleet at 1145 EVE
      time with an expected departure at 1200 EVE in Zoohen. I undocked and started searching for a suitable subject for
      our content, and found one within two jumps of Zoohen, and it turned out to be a C2 Wormhole, in the next several
      minutes. Inside there was one combat site, 3 forgotten data sites, and two more forgotten relic sites.

      The fleet entered and we started running content, with DPS clearing the grid before the newer members would warp
      in and hack the cans at their convenience. We had one small scare when seeing a Buzzard on D-Scan, which turned
      out to be our own member @Unknown., his ship was promptly renamed. @Atvas Rotsuda had to drop fleet and comms to
      attend to other business within Signal Cartel. Myself, I had passed off FC to @Dude Johnson for a short while so
      I could attend to some IRL business. Upon returning, FC was passed back, and we cleared the remaining 4 sites
      within the wormhole.

      All in all, a great spontaneous fleet, we got some great experience, had some loot and made some ISK. A few
      members had forgone a share which was then donated to Signal Cartel, to benefit new members and exploration.

      Big shout out to all members who came and participated! 10/10 will certainly do again.

      It was a great turnout. We smashed a lot of sleepers. Something like 16 sites, clearing the whole system of combat
      sites. Everyone was patient with me as a green FC (thanks) and we had some first timers. I learned a lot and had
      a lot of fun!

      The 2 logi frigates were more than was necessary, and we discussed possibly doing mixed logi/dps in the future,
      though it does work as a good training ground for future Guardian pilots.

      All told the loot was worth $58,897,551 ISK per pilot. Let me know if you didn't receive it.

    title: "AAR: First Frigate Swarm Fleet"
    organizer: "Lavoleine Audier"
    description: >
      A ragtag team of 21 T1 and T2 frigates and destroyers left Zoohen Station late Thursday (and Friday morning for
      some) to venture into j-space. Our goal was to see how far we could push our little ships into the realm of the
      Sleepers. Our fleet consisted of a Federation Navy Comet, a Punisher, a Rifter, a Tristan, four Retributions, a
      Vengeance, three Wolves (growl!), two Maguses, a Pontifex, a Sentinel, three Deacons, a Thalia, and last but not
      least, a Nemesis.

      I’ll start with the result: we absolutely dominated the Sleepers tonight from C3 to C5 — all without a single
      ship loss. What the Sleepers experienced was exactly what I had envisioned for the fleet: a frigate swarm with a
      sprinkle of destroyers. It wasn’t even a contest; the Sleepers didn’t know what to do with us. We disrupted their
      weapons, webbed them, and blew holes into their ships, all while being supported by a crack logi team that kept
      us healthy and a Sentinel piloted by @Elizbeta Decoherant to keep their guns at bay. On top of that, our salvager
      @Rani Ulfr not only cleaned up the mess we made, but also helped us bookmark perches, navigate wormholes, finding
      a SAR and ultimately get home.

      We completed approximately 14 sites and recovered loot worth about 960 million ISK, which included around 67
      million in salvage. I will donate my share to the SRP, which insured our ships.

      So how did we get here? We started out in Zoohen discussing the use of command destroyer bursts and who would
      handle which type of charge so they wouldn’t stack. We ultimately decided @Rachel Morgan would manage skirmish
      bursts due to his skills, while the remainder ran complementary information and armor bursts. We also discussed
      fleet structure and chose simplicity: logi in one group, everyone else in another. Rachel was assigned XO thanks
      to his fleet experience and excellent combat organization skills.

      We then set out to confront the Sleepers in a C3. Since ad hoc small fleets had already proven successful there,
      we felt upgrading to a C4 would be quick — and it was. As expected, the fleet dominated C3 sites in about six
      minutes (or less) and we soon decided it was time to upgrade. We went next door to a C4 site whose connecting
      wormhole was at end of life. We took the risk of being cut off and plunged forward.

      We warped to our first C4 site, Integrated Terminus, and utterly obliterated it. We pressed on into a Frontier
      Barracks — Obliterating it. Success was becoming routine. We upped the ante with several unsecured sites,
      thinking they’d be a good preview of C5. Again, we crushed them in short order! Our team was unstoppable. The
      only hiccup came in the Unsecured Frontier Digital Nexus, which required a Data Analyzer to spawn the next wave.
      @Rani Ulfr graciously jumped back to k-space to grab the module, brought it back, and I equipped it so we could
      continue our Sleeper demolition.

      At that point, we decided to return to the C3 and enter a connecting shattered C5 Wolf Rayet wormhole — Until
      @Rani Ulfr informed us that the end-of-life wormhole had closed behind us. Cut off, our explorer instincts kicked
      in. @Rani Ulfr scanned down the other static C5, which wasn’t a Wolf Rayet. We hesitated at first, but consensus
      was clear: Push forward. The fleet splashed into the C5.

      @Rani Ulfr set up a perch for a Core Garrison site, but we were missing one fleet member, @Ddado. He showed up
      shortly after, announcing he had “tended the cache” — True Signal Cartel style. We warped in and promptly began
      serving Drifters up on a silver platter. During the second wave, we accidentally spawned the next wave, which
      added three more battleships and eight cruisers. Suddenly, we were facing 6 battleships and a host of cruisers.
      This was our real test. Under the direction of our experienced XO, @Rachel Morgan, we kept calm, maintained
      rhythm, and coordinated target calling to avoid overlapping disruptors and focus fire effectively. Logi worked
      overtime and truly shined — several members dipped into hull (including logi themselves), but the team brought
      them back until the DPS pressure eased. Our lone Sentinel, flown by @Elizbeta Decoherant, also excelled,
      ensuring very few hostile shots landed deeply into armor.

      Without the logi and ewar teams, we would have taken losses — Full stop.

      During our time in the C5, @Rani Ulfr also reported coming upon an SAR. Unprecedented Signal Cartel luck!

      Once the Core Garrison was complete, we considered spawning the Drifter. But without warp scramblers to hold it
      in place, the fleet decided to leave on a high note and head home as it was getting late.

      Of course, while attempting to exit the C5, we learned that @Graphite couldn’t resist. With @Aithra Dreamweaver
      present, they spawned the Drifter and unleashed it. They survived! I would have loved to see that.

      All in all, this fleet was a resounding success; beyond what I had envisioned for our first outing.

      We can credit the doctrine, the consistent discussions about fittings to ensure survivability, the ad hoc fleets
      that proved the concept, the target calling and battlefield organization, the loot logistics and bookmarking, or
      the absolute crack team of pilots who knew their jobs, communicated clearly, and executed brilliantly. I believe
      it was all of the above!
