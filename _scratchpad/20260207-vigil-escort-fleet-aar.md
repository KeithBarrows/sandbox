**Fleet Summary:**
The Molea Memorial Escort Hugs Fleet formed up at Zoohen III at 2245 EVE Time, with a scheduled departure at 2300. The fleet, led by FC Isaac Apylon and joined by special guest Kaeracin, set out to honor the memory of Rhoswen Siara. The route included a stop in Low Sec for a 10-minute cyno lighting before proceeding to the Molea Capsuleer Memorial. Along the way, fireworks were provided, and a poem was read by Edwaren Alduin. The event was marked by camaraderie, remembrance, and the participation of many Signal Cartel members and friends from the New Eden community. The fleet arrived at the Molea Memorial, where respects were paid and the memory of the fallen was honored.

**Lessons Learned:**
- The importance of clear communication and coordination for memorial fleets.
- The value of community support and participation in honoring fellow capsuleers.
- Ensuring all technical and logistical aspects (such as cyno lighting and fireworks) are prepared in advance.

**Future Directions:**
- Continue to offer private memorial fleets for the New Eden community upon request.
- Refine procedures for future memorials to ensure smooth operations and meaningful experiences for all participants.
